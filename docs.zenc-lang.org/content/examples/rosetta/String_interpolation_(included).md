# String interpolation (included)

Zen C supports implicit string interpolation. By enclosing a variable or expression in braces <code>{}</code> within a string literal, the compiler automatically formats and inserts the value. 

Further documentation on string formatting and escaping can be found in the [https://github.com/z-libs/Zen-C official language reference].

```zc
fn main() {
    let word = "little";
    
    // The variable 'word' is interpolated directly into the string
    println "Mary had a {word} lamb";
}
```

**Output:**

```zc
Mary had a little lamb
```
