# Numbers which are not the sum of distinct squares

**Output:**

```
Numbers which are not the sum of distinct squares:
2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 15, 18, 19, 22, 23, 24, 27, 28, 31, 32, 33, 43, 44, 47, 48, 60, 67, 72, 76, 92, 96, 108, 112, 128  

Found 31 such numbers.

Stopped checking after finding 130 sequential non-gaps after the final gap of 128.
