# Integer comparison

```zc
fn main() {
    let a: int;
    let b: int;
    
    ? "Enter two integers separated by a space: " (a, b);
    
    if a < b {
        println "{a} is less than {b}";
    }
    
    if a == b {
        println "{a} is equal to {b}";
    }
    
    if a > b {
        println "{a} is greater than {b}";
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```zc
Enter two integers separated by a space: 42 17
42 is greater than 17
```
