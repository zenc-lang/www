# A+B

Zen C features a built-in shorthand for reading user input using the <code>?</code> operator. Format specifiers are automatically inferred based on the types of the variables. When evaluated, it returns the number of successfully read items.

```zc
fn main() {
    let a: int;
    let b: int;
    
    // Read two space-separated integers directly from the input stream
    if (? a, b) == 2 {
        let sum = a + b;
        println "{sum}";
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```zc
2 2
4
```
